OpenCV Assignment
Description
This project is part of a robotics and OpenCV assignment that involves processing images and demonstrating the use of Python with OpenCV. The project includes the necessary files to set up a Python environment and run the program to produce image processing results.

Features
Image input and processing using OpenCV.
Output result images for visualization.
Easy setup with a virtual environment.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/SibomanaEdouard/edouard_openCV_proj.git
cd assignment
Set Up Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script
Execute the main script:

python app.py
How to Use
Add input images to the images/ directory.
Customize app.py if additional processing logic is required.
Run the script to generate output, such as result.jpg.
Important Notes
The venv/ folder is excluded from Git using .gitignore to avoid pushing it to the repository.
Always update requirements.txt if you add new Python packages:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Example Output
The result.jpg file represents the processed output image generated by the program.

images/result.jpg
